## Description

In the post-Covid world, physical classes will continue to be held. However, when cases are confirmed in schools, students are forced online until ringfencing is completed. This back and forth between physical and online lessons disjoints the learning experience, disrupting studentsâ€™ day-to-day activities. Hence, we have built an app that complements hybrid learning, allowing students to better adjust into this new norm and increase student and teacher interactions and engagement in both the physical and online space.

## Final Thoughts

Went into this competition with almost no knowledge on app development. CODE_EXP did provide a 4-day crash course on React Native, covering a basic CRUD todo app with Firebase authentication, which was very helpful. However, communication within the team was disjointed, with 2 of the members (originally 5) contributing nothing. Moreover, because one of the members had a lot more experience, he did most of the legwork especially for the backend while me and the other guy managed the frontend, mainly the quiz components and screens. 

Coupled with time constraints and the need to do a 10-slide slide deck AND a 3 minute video demo, our three-ish team did not manage to produce the best possible app. Moreover, I personally feel too much time was invested into setting up a proper backend when the competition mainly focused on a well-produced idea, to the extent of being able to just submit a no-code mockup. Perhaps just purely focusing on design and extensive functionalities (maybe with some API to make it look more realistic and "filled-in"), would be a better approach next time. 

All in all, it was a good experience on understanding the basics of app development. Though, the thought of having to do frontend and backend, while simultaneously struggling to unify both Android and iOS experiences (even in React Native, a cross-development tool) do be a massive pain. 

Lastly, I did crash-coursed Adobe Premiere in order to stitch together the 3 minute video all within a few hours and I am probably most proud of that.
